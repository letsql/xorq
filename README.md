xorq is a deferred computation toolchain that brings the replicability and
performance of declarative pipelines to the Python ML ecosystem. It enables us
to write pandas-style transformations that never run out of memory,
automatically cache intermediate results, and seamlessly move between SQL
engines and Python UDFsâ€”all while maintaining replicability. xorq is built on
top of Ibis and DataFusion.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Declarative expressions** | Built on Ibis, supporting multiple SQL engines |
| **Built-in caching** | Automatically invalidates when dependencies change |
| **Multi-engine** | Seamlessly mix SQL engines with Python processing |
| **Serializable pipelines** | YAML definitions for version control and CI/CD |
| **Portable UDFs** | Portable UDFs |
| **Arrow-native architecture** | High-performance data transfer between components |

## Getting Started
xorq functions as both an interactive library for building expressions and a
command-line interface. This dual nature enables seamless transition
from exploratory research to production-ready artifacts. The steps below will
guide through using both the CLI and library components to get started.

> [!CAUTION] 
> This library does not currently have a stable release. Both the
> API and implementation are subject to change, and future updates may not be
> backward compatible.
### Installation

xorq is available as [`xorq`](https://pypi.org/project/xorq/) on PyPI:

```shell
pip install xorq
```

> [!NOTE]
> We are changing the name from LETSQL to xorq.

### Usage

```python
import xorq as xo


pg = xo.postgres.connect_env()
db = xo.duckdb.connect()

batting = pg.table("batting")
awards_players = xo.examples.awards_players.fetch(backend=db)

left = batting.filter(batting.yearID == 2015)

right = (awards_players.filter(awards_players.lgID == "NL")
                       .drop("yearID", "lgID")
                       .into_backend(pg, "filtered"))

expr = (left.join(right, ["playerID"], how="semi")
            .cache()
            .select(["yearID", "stint"]))

# expr.build().execute()
result = expr.execute()
```

for more examples on how to use letsql, check the
[examples](https://github.com/letsql/xorq/tree/main/examples) directory, note
that in order to run some of the scripts in there, you need to install the
library with `examples` extra:

```shell
pip install 'xorq[examples]'
```
