title: 'Building with xorq'
---

xorq provides a command-line interface with a `build` command that allows you to generate artifacts from Ibis expressions defined in Python scripts. This tutorial will walk you through using this functionality.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have xorq installed:

```bash
pip install xorq
```

## Basic Usage

The basic syntax for the `build` command is:

```bash
xorq build <script_path> -e <expression_name> --target-dir <output_directory>
```

Where:
- `<script_path>` is the path to your Python script containing the expression
- `<expression_name>` is the name of the variable holding the Ibis expression
- `<output_directory>` is where the artifacts will be generated (defaults to "build")

## Example

Let's create a simple script that defines an Ibis expression:

```python
# pipeline.py
import xorq as xo

# Connect to data source
con = xo.connect()

# Create a simple dataframe
df = con.create_table("people",
                      {"name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"],
                       "age": [25, 30, 35]})

# Define your expression
expr = df.filter(df.age > 30).select("name")
```

Now, let's build this expression using the CLI:

```bash
xorq build pipeline.py -e expr --target-dir artifacts
```

This command will:
1. Load the `pipeline.py` script
2. Find the `expr` variable
3. Generate artifacts based on the expression
4. Save them to the `artifacts` directory

You should see output similar to:
```
Building expr from pipeline.py
Written 'expr' to artifacts/2a3b46d8d3d0
```

## Use Cases

This functionality is particularly useful for:

- Saving compiled expressions for later execution
- Sharing expressions between different systems
- Version controlling complex data transformations
- Pre-compiling expressions for production deployments

## Error Handling

The CLI will provide helpful error messages if:

- The script doesn't exist
- The expression variable isn't found in the script
- The variable isn't an Ibis expression
- No expression name is provided
